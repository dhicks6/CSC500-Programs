Pseudocode for Mod 1 Critical Thinking

Ask the user for two numbers and store them in vars named num1 and num2
Add num1 by num2 then print the result
Subtract num1 by num2 then print the result

Ask the user for two more numbers and store them in vars named num1 and num2
Python will "overwrite" the values previously stored in num1 and num2 so we do not
    need to worry about clearing them out
Multiply num1 by num2 then print the result
Divide num1 by num2 then print the result
